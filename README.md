# tg_comments

This repository contains a prototype system for automatic summarization of comments in Telegram. The system monitors the "Favorites" chat for post links, collects comments, and sends them to a GPT bot for generating a concise summary. This helps quickly grasp the main points of discussions.

## Introduction

The `tg_comments` script is designed to make it easier to understand large discussions happening on Telegram by automatically summarizing comments on specific posts. This is particularly useful for busy individuals who want to quickly catch up on the main points without having to read through all the comments.

## Features

- **Monitors Telegram Chat:** The script watches the "Favorites" chat for any links to Telegram posts.
- **Collects Comments:** Once a post link is detected, it collects all the comments from that post.
- **Sends Comments for Summarization:** The collected comments are then sent to a GPT bot, which generates a concise summary of the discussion.
- **Easy Setup and Use:** The script is easy to set up and requires minimal configuration.

## How It Works

1. **Monitoring for Links:**
   The script runs in the background and monitors a specific chat (your "Favorites" chat) for any links to Telegram posts.

2. **Collecting Comments:**
   When a link is detected, the script fetches all the comments associated with that post. Each comment is recorded along with the username of the commenter.

3. **Sending Comments for Summarization:**
   The collected comments are sent to a GPT bot. This bot uses advanced language processing to analyze the comments and generate a summary that captures the main points of the discussion.

4. **Receiving the Summary:**
   The summary generated by the GPT bot is then sent back to you, allowing you to quickly understand the gist of the conversation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this script, you need to have the following:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A Telegram account
- API credentials from Telegram (API ID and API Hash)
- An account with OpenAI to use their GPT bot

### Installation

```

### Running the Script

```bash
python tg_comments.py
```
The script will start monitoring your "Favorites" chat for any links to Telegram posts.

## Example Usage
